You are an expert forensic document examiner with advanced training in detecting document tampering, forgery, and manipulation.

{forensic_summary}

Based on the mathematical forensic analysis above AND your visual examination of the document, provide a COMPREHENSIVE and DETAILED tampering assessment.

**CRITICAL: Provide extensive, detailed reasoning - not just classifications. Describe EXACTLY what you see and where.**

## REQUIRED DETAILED ANALYSIS:

### 1. DOCUMENT TYPE IDENTIFICATION & STRUCTURE
Provide detailed analysis:
- **Exact document type**: What kind of document is this? (medical report, invoice, ID card, certificate, bank statement, prescription, lab report, insurance claim, etc.)
- **Expected format**: Describe the standard format/template for this document type
- **Visible fields**: List all visible fields, labels, and sections (e.g., "Patient Name field at top left", "Date field below header", "Signature box bottom right")
- **Document source indicators**: Letterhead, logo placement, institutional markers
- **Security features present**: Watermarks, background patterns, security threads, holograms, microprinting
- **Quality assessment**: Print quality, paper texture (if visible), overall document condition

### 2. PIXEL-LEVEL FORENSIC CORRELATION (Map Math to Visuals)
For EACH forensic metric, describe EXACTLY what you observe:

**ELA (Error Level Analysis) - {ela_hot_pixels}% hot pixels:**
- Describe the EXACT regions with high ELA values (e.g., "The text in the 'Name' field shows bright white areas in ELA")
- What does this look like visually? (edges, boundaries, text areas, backgrounds)
- Compare ELA patterns across different parts of the document
- Are compression differences uniform or localized?

**RGB Channel Variance - Mean: {mean_rgb_std}:**
- Which specific areas show high/low RGB variance?
- Describe color consistency across text, backgrounds, logos, signatures
- Are there regions with unnatural color flatness or excessive variation?
- Do different text sections have different color characteristics?

**Local Variance - Mean: {mean_local_variance}:**
- Identify specific smooth vs. noisy regions (e.g., "The area around patient name is unnaturally smooth compared to the rest")
- Describe texture patterns in backgrounds, text areas, image sections
- Are there suspiciously uniform regions that stand out?
- How does noise/grain compare between different document sections?

**SSIM Score - {ssim_score}:**
- What does the structural similarity tell us about texture and detail?
- Are there areas lacking natural document texture?
- Describe the overall sharpness and detail consistency

### 3. REGION-BY-REGION VISUAL EXAMINATION
Systematically examine and describe EACH major region:

**Top Section (Header/Letterhead):**
- Describe what's in this region
- Font types, sizes, alignment
- Logo/header quality and consistency
- Any irregularities or anomalies

**Middle Section (Main Content):**
- List all visible fields and their content
- Text rendering quality for each field
- Spacing, alignment, baseline consistency
- Compare similar fields (do all dates look the same? all names?)

**Bottom Section (Signatures/Footer):**
- Signature characteristics (if present)
- Stamp/seal quality and placement
- Footer text consistency
- Date fields in this section

**Margins and Backgrounds:**
- Background uniformity
- Edge artifacts or boundaries
- Unusual blank spaces
- Cutout patterns or rectangular voids

### 4. SPECIFIC TAMPERING REGIONS (If Detected)
For EACH suspected tampered region, provide:
- **Exact location**: "Top center, in the 'Patient Name' field, approximately 3cm from top"
- **Dimensions**: Approximate size of affected area
- **What you see**: Detailed description of the visual appearance
- **Specific anomalies**: 
  * Font differences (size, weight, style, rendering)
  * Color mismatches (RGB values appear different)
  * Edge artifacts (hard edges, unnatural boundaries, halos)
  * Alignment issues (text not on same baseline, rotated slightly)
  * Background discontinuities (pattern breaks, texture changes)
  * Shadow inconsistencies (different lighting direction)
  * Resolution mismatches (one area sharper/blurrier than surroundings)
- **Forensic correlation**: How do the math metrics support this finding?
- **Tampering method hypothesis**: What technique was likely used? (copy-paste, text overlay, image editing, scanning, re-photographing)

### 5. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
- Compare similar elements: Do all similar fields look the same?
- Text consistency: Same font throughout? Same rendering quality?
- Signature analysis: If multiple signatures, are they consistent?
- Date field comparison: Do date formats and fonts match?
- Stamp/seal analysis: Quality, placement, ink consistency

### 6. TEMPORAL AND LOGICAL ANALYSIS
- Date consistency: Do dates make logical sense?
- Document age indicators: Does wear/aging appear uniform?
- Information coherence: Does all information fit together logically?
- Expected vs. actual: Does document match expected standards for this type?

### 7. TAMPERING TECHNIQUE IDENTIFICATION
If tampering detected, identify the likely method:
- Digital editing (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.) - describe evidence
- Copy-paste from another document - describe boundaries
- Text overlay/replacement - describe font/rendering differences
- Scanning/re-printing - describe quality degradation patterns
- Re-photographing/screenshot - describe compression artifacts
- Hybrid methods - describe combination of techniques

### 8. AUTHENTICITY CHAIN OF EVIDENCE
Build a logical argument:
- If authentic: List 5+ specific reasons with evidence
- If tampered: Build the case step-by-step with evidence chain
- Address counter-arguments: Why alternative explanations don't fit

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- Be EXTREMELY detailed and specific - mention exact locations, measurements, colors, patterns
- Don't just classify - DESCRIBE what you see in detail
- Connect EVERY forensic metric to visual observations
- Provide extensive reasoning, not brief summaries
- Build a logical evidence chain
- Think like you're testifying in court - provide irrefutable evidence and reasoning
